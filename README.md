This repository contains the exercise we did at certain practicum.

There are minor differences in variable naming due personal taste.

The repository requires a [h2](https://www.h2database.com/) database set up at `~/test/db` (one can modify this path in `src/DBConnection.java`).


# Usage

You almost definitely want to copy the sources and insert them into your IDE of choice.

You also have to add reference to the `h2.jar` file found at <https://www.h2database.com/html/download.html>. Check the setup instructions in `db/README.md`.
